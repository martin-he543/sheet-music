# Sheet Music

##### The following is a showcase of various things I have composed and arranged over the years, to varying degrees of quality.

## Compositions
### Opus 1
- **Opus 1 No 1 "Enfance"**
##### Composed: October 2014
Probably the first piece I ever composed in earnest for the "Rondo" brief given in Year 7 Music class. I still proudly (though misguidedly) maintain that this was the most-liked composition in my entire school's Noteflight whilst it was actively available.

- **Opus 1 No 2 "Jeunesse"**
##### Composed: 2018
The first, original *"Interpretation and Interpolation"* as it came to be known for Music class, which was rather just an enormous euphemism for ghostwriting coursework on a commission-wise basis. In this musical number, my teacher accused me of plagiarism Mozart.

- **Opus 1 No 3 "Hubristique"**
##### Composed: 2018 - 2019
A miserable piece with an noticeable second variation, inspired in the style of Chopin. I had the stupid idea of embedding a triplet within a triplet, and then just ran with it. The final variation is best described as a metaphorical scream of disillusionment, ending on a hopeful *tierce de picardie.* I was obsessed with the ideas of *hubris* from Classic Mythology at the time as well as Shakespeare (i.e. Macbeth), hence the title.

- **Opus 1 No 4 "Souffrance"**
##### Composed: 2018 - 2019
As the title suggest, suffering. I came up with the first variational motif in a garden shed whilst wearing a very large coat and shivering profusely.

- **Opus 1 No 5 "Nostalgique"**
##### Composed: 2019
A piece that was composed in under 30 minutes. Once the initial motif appeared in my head, in what can only be described as a interesting take on *Chim Chim Cheree*, the rest briskly followed. This piece takes a stroll exploring the relative major, before returning to the initial theme in a cyclical manner, with a wistful *coda* that embodies this nostalgia. As the fantastic *Raya Kostava* summed it up: *"it's sounds like you have the soul of a 70 year old French man smoking cigarettes on a balcony."*

- **"Eudaimonia"**
##### Composed: 2020
Eudaimonia, or εὐδαιμονία, roughly translated meaning: *happiness, wellbeing, state of inner-peace,* was composed on New Year's Day, 2020, during a period of relative happiness after several years of depressive episodes. Little did I know, the chaos that would ensue in this ripe, new decade

## Arrangements
- **Rather Be for Four Hands**
##### Arrangement: 2017
Based on the fantastic song by Clean Bandit in 2014 which would not exit my brain for a good 5 years straight comes this arrangement. Originally intended for GCSE Ensemble performance coursework with a friend, Nick, eventually, this arrangement would be used to create versions for the violin (performed with the fantastic *James Hur*), as well as part of a set-list (with my friend Bruno).

- **Chandelier for Four Hands**
##### Arrangement: 2017
Based on the song by Sia, also originally intended for my GCSE Ensemble Performance. However, the refusal of Mr. O'Malley led this arrangement to a dead end. To be fair, he was correct as both parts were horribly synchronised and insufficiently difficult.
